! Set initial condition
integer x = 0.0     ! This should be a real, not an integer
integer h = 0.1     ! This should be a real, not an integer
integer n = 100     ! Double definition of n
real, parameter :: pi = 3.14159265359
integer :: i, n   ! Double definition of n
real :: differential_equation ! This is not needed
! Function for the differential equation
real  differential_equation(x, y)
  real, intent(in) :: x, y  ! Declare arguments as real and intent(in)
  differential_equation = sin(x) - y * tan(x)  ! Calculate the equation
  ! Solve the ODE using a loop
